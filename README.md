# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview

Within the challenge we are doing to help Dana, data journalist. She is excited to prepare an article about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon, and,, even more excited about the topic UFOs. The purpose of the project is to prepare a table based on UFO observations. The table should have a feature of being filtered py different parameters simultaniously.
Within the project we relied on the followind technologies:
* CSS, HTML and Bootstrap library
* JavaScript and D3.js library

The project rusults are deployed as a one-page website here: [UFO Sightings](https://arminekhanan.github.io/ufoSightings/?fbclid=IwAR08vbEpIGP0NE9V9m5K0yLr5ejo5JoZLddIxPYtIl-09kG7ZqpL60XocoQ).

## Results

### Filters

The user can interact with the table by applying the following filters, situated on the left-hand side of the webpage:

Date, accepting Month-Day-Year without leading zeros format date values.
City, accepting lowercase city name values.
State, accepting lowercase USPS abbriviations of the states.
Country, accepting ISO-3166-1 ALPHA-2 country code values typed lowercase.
Shape, accepting lowercase one-word descriptions in english

### Apllying multiple filters and resetting
To run the filter the user should enter the value in an expected format and hit enter. Every filter accepts only one value at a time. Filters work in combination. To go back to the initial table content on can press the "UFO Sightings" text a the very top left-hand side of the page.
